Just noting the more difficult aspects of the implementation:

1. Could not get Tkinter to behave as well as I wanted, especially when it comes to the sizes of labels, input fields,
text boxes, so on. Using some hardcoded numbers, the app functions, but it is not as flexible as desired

2. I did not find a way to use json module to assign the API response to python objects, as noted in ParseJson.py

Note: I used some background colours in the frames and labels. This was for seeing what sizes the frames are given
and how the layout looks like. Design considerations were minimal
